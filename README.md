# ChirpFAN: Chirplet Fourier Analysis Network for Cross-Scene Classification of Multisource Remote Sensing Data

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Chirplet Fourier Analysis Network for Cross-Scene Classification of Multisource Remote Sensing Data", published in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), 2025.

## Usage

### Data set links

1. Houston dataset were introduced for the 2013 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion contest. Data set links comes from http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/2013-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest/

2. The authors would like to thank Dr. P. Ghamisi for providing the Trento Data. 

### Training

Train the HSI and LiDAR-based DSM
```
python Train_HMDADANet_NAHA.py 
```

## Results
